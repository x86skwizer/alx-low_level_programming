# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This repository contains programs written in C that demonstrate the of dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free` functions.

## Requirements

* All files are written and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

## Usage

* All C files are to be compiled using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* The code is to be executed in the shell.

## List of Programs

* **0-create_array.c** - A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
* **1-strdup.c** - A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
* **2-str_concat.c** - A function that concatenates two strings.
* **3-alloc_grid.c** - A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
* **4-free_grid.c** - A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by the `alloc_grid` function.
* **5-argstostr.c** - A function that concatenates all the arguments of the program.
* **100-strtow.c** - A function that splits a string into words.
