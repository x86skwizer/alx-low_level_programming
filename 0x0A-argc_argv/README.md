# Welcome to the readme for 0x0A. C - argc, argv!

This project is designed to help you understand how to use command line arguments in C programming. The main focus of this project is to teach you how to use the `argc` and `argv` parameters in the `main` function to pass arguments to your program.

## In this project, you will learn how to:

- Use `argc` and `argv` to pass arguments to your program
- Parse command line arguments using `getopt`
- Handle errors and invalid input

## Getting Started

To get started, you should have a basic understanding of C programming and how to use the command line. You will also need a C compiler installed on your computer.

## The project contains several files, including:

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: A program that prints its name
- `1-args.c`: A program that prints all arguments it receives
- `2-args.c`: A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it
- `3-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments
- `4-add.c`: A program that adds positive numbers passed as arguments
- `100-change.c`: A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money

## To compile the programs, use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output>
```

Replace `<filename.c>` with the name of the file you want to compile and `<output>` with the name of the output file.
