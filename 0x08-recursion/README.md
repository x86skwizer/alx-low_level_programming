# 0x08-recursion

This project focuses on the concept of recursion in C programming. Recursion is a powerful technique that allows a function to call itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of recursion and how it can be used in programming
- Write recursive functions to solve specific problems or tasks
- Avoid common pitfalls of recursion, such as infinite loops
- Optimize recursive functions for performance

## Requirements

To complete this project, you will need:

- A computer running a Unix-based operating system (such as Linux or macOS)
- The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) installed on your system
- A text editor for writing C code (such as Vim or Emacs)

## Project Tasks

This project consists of several tasks, each of which involves writing a recursive function to solve a specific problem or task. The tasks are as follows:

- **0-puts_recursion.c**: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a newline, using recursion.
- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: Write a function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: Write a function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.
- **3-factorial.c**: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion.
- **4-pow_recursion.c**: Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, using recursion.
- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion.
- **6-is_prime_number.c**: Write a function that checks if a given number is a prime number, using recursion.
- **7-is_palindrome.c**: Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome, using recursion.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Read the instructions for each task in the corresponding C file.
4. Write your solution for each task in the corresponding C file.
5. Compile your code using GCC.
6. Test your code using the provided test files.

## Testing

To test your code, run the corresponding test file for each task. For example, to test your solution for task 0, run the following command:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-puts_recursion.c -o test0
$ ./0
```

If your code passes all the tests, you should see output similar to the following:

```
$ ./test0
