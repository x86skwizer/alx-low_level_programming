## Description

The **0x0E-structures_typedef** project introduces the concept of structures and typedef in C programming. Structures allow us to group related data together into a single unit, while typedef provides a way to create aliases for existing data types. This project provides hands-on experience in working with structures and typedef, understanding their syntax, and utilizing them effectively in C programs.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `dog.h`: A header file that contains the definition of a structure called `dog`.
- `1-init_dog.c`: A C file that defines a function `init_dog()` to initialize the members of the `dog` structure.
- `2-print_dog.c`: A C file that defines a function `print_dog()` to print the members of the `dog` structure.
- `4-new_dog.c`: A C file that defines a function `new_dog()` to create a new `dog` structure and initialize its members.
- `5-free_dog.c`: A C file that defines a function `free_dog()` to free the memory allocated for a `dog` structure.

## Requirements

To compile and run the files in this project, you need:

- A C compiler such as `gcc`
- The standard C library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/0x0E-structures_typedef.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 0x0E-structures_typedef
   ```

3. Compile the C files using the following command:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o program
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```
   ./program
   ```
