## Description

The **0x12-singly_linked_lists** project introduces the concept of singly linked lists in C programming. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. This project provides hands-on experience in working with singly linked lists, understanding their structure, and implementing various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `lists.h`: A header file that contains the function prototypes and structure definition for the singly linked list.
- `0-print_list.c`: A C file that defines a function `print_list()` to print all the elements of a singly linked list.
- `1-list_len.c`: A C file that defines a function `list_len()` to calculate the number of elements in a singly linked list.
- `2-add_node.c`: A C file that defines a function `add_node()` to add a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
- `3-add_node_end.c`: A C file that defines a function `add_node_end()` to add a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
- `4-free_list.c`: A C file that defines a function `free_list()` to free the memory allocated for a singly linked list.

## Requirements

 and run files in this project, you need:

- A C compiler such as `gcc`
- The standard C library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/0x12-singly_linked_lists.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 0x12-singly_linked_lists
   ```

3. Compile the C files using the following command:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -WerrorWextra -o program
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```
   ./program
   ```
