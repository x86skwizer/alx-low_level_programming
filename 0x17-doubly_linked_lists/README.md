# 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

Welcome to the 0x17-doubly_linked_lists project! This project focuses on doubly linked lists, a data structure that consists of nodes with references to both the next and previous nodes in the list. This project will help you understand the concepts of doubly linked lists and how to implement them in C.

## Description

The 0x17-doubly_linked_lists project is a collection of C files that implement various operations on doubly linked lists. Each file contains a specific set of functions that perform operations such as adding nodes, deleting nodes, traversing the list, and more.

The project is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of doubly linked lists and improve your C programming skills. It provides a hands-on experience in implementing and manipulating this data structure.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code in this project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. The code is written in the C programming language and is compatible with the C99 standard.

## Usage

To use the functions provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the "alx-program" repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/alx-low_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the "0x17-doubly_linked_lists" project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-program/0x17-doubly_linked_lists
   ```

3. Compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o doubly_linked_list
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./doubly_linked_list
   ```

   This will execute the main program, which demonstrates the usage of the doubly linked list functions.
