# **ALX School Low-Level Programming**
This repository contains a collection of projects for ALX School's low-level programming curriculum. The projects are designed to challenge students and help them develop a deep understanding of computer architecture and operating systems, as well as a strong grasp of C programming concepts such as pointers, memory management, and data structures.

## **Getting Started**
To get started with these projects, you will need to have a working knowledge of C programming and computer architecture. You will also need to have a development environment set up on your computer, including a C compiler and any necessary libraries.

## **Project Structure**
The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each containing code for a specific project. The subdirectories include:
- **`0x00-hello_world:`** This directory contains code for a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- **`0x01-variables_if_else_while:`** This directory contains code for programs that use variables, if/else statements, and loops.
- **`0x02-functions_nested_loops:`** This directory contains code for programs that use functions and nested loops.
- **`0x03-debugging:`** This directory contains code for programs that require debugging.
- **`0x04-more_functions_nested_loops:`** This directory contains code for programs that use more advanced functions and nested loops.
- **`0x05-pointers_arrays_strings:`** This directory contains code for programs that use pointers, arrays, and strings.
- **`0x06-pointers_arrays_strings:`** This directory contains code for more advanced programs that use pointers, arrays, and strings.
- **`0x07-pointers_arrays_strings:`** This directory contains code for even more advanced programs that use pointers, arrays, and strings.
