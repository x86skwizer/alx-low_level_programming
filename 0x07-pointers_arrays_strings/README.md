# 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains programs written in C that use pointers, arrays, and strings. These programs are part of ALX School's low-level programming curriculum.

## List of Programs

The following is a list of the programs in this directory:

- **0-memset.c:** A function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- **1-memcpy.c:** A function that copies memory area.
- **2-strchr.c:** A function that locates a character in a string.
- **3-strspn.c:** A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- **4-strpbrk.c:** A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
- **5-strstr.c:** A function that locates a substring.
- **7-print_chessboard.c:** A function that prints the chessboard.
- **8-print_diagsums.c:** A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

## How to Use

To use these programs, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. You can compile the programs using the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output-file>
```

Replace `<output-file>` with the name of the executable file you want to create.

Once you have compiled the program, you can run it using the following command:

```
./<output-file>
```

Replace `<output-file>` with the name of the executable file you created.
